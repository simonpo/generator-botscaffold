# Generator-botcaffold

Yeoman Generator for creating the scaffolding of an app using Microsoft Bot Framework and Node.js. 

## Getting started
- Assume you already have Node.js installed
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-botscaffold`
- Create a directory to hold your bot's code, and cd into it
- Run: `yo botscaffold`

## Features

- Scaffolds a Node.js Bot Framework app
- Creates a launch.json skeleton for easy inclusion of env variables using VS Code
- Creates a basic readme
- Builds your package.json

## Why?

I've been building a lot of small Node.js apps using the Microsoft Bot Framework. This generator scaffolds a new app with a common structure and template files, saving a ton of time.
