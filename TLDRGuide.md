# TL;DR Setup Guide #

The [complete Setup Guide](SetupGuide.md) is quite long. If you've used Azure services before, here's a condensed version of that Guide to get you going more quickly: 

- Create a Web App in Azure to host your Bot
- Create a Bot at botframework.com
- Configure App Insights on the Azure portal
- Create a LUIS instance
- Enter some environment variables in the Azure portal
- Customize the framework generated by Botscaffold, and publish it to GitHub
- Configure the Web App to pull your code from GitHub

##Sign into Azure##

##Create a Web App in Azure to host your Bot##
- As you're creating the web app, choose **On** for **App Insights**
- Copy/paste your **Web App URL** into a text file
- Change the protocol to **https**, and add **/api/messages** to the end of the URL.
- Save this info, it will be your Bot's messaging endpoint

##Create a Bot at botframework.com##
- Go to [https://dev.botframework.com](https://dev.botframework.com) and sign in
- Create a new Bot under **My Bots**
- 

##Configure App Insights on the Azure portal##
On the Azure portal, configure **App Insights**
Paste the **App Insights Instrumentation Key** into a text file and save it somewhere safe. 

##Create a LUIS instance##
Go to [https://luis.ai](https://luis.ai/)

##Enter details in the Botscaffold Generator##
You now have all the details you need. Enter the following into the Botscaffold generator:

App ID
App Password
App Insights Instrumentation Key 

##Enter some environment variables in the Azure portal##
Go to your Web App on the Azure portal

In **Application Settings** tab, enter the following Key/Value pairs under the APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY that has already been created:

- MY_APP_ID
- MY_APP_PASSWORD
- MY_LUIS_MODEL 

You can find the correct values in your .vscode\launch.json file, if you need. 

##Customize the framework generated by Botscaffold, and publish it to GitHub##
Change the functionality of your bot locally by editing **app.js** as needed
Push your entire codebase to a GitHub repo

##Configure the Web App to pull your code from GitHub##
In the Azure portal, select the **Deployment Options** tab
Choose **GitHub** as your source, and enter the required settings.
Any change you push to GitHub will now automatically deploy to Azure

##Test your Bot running on Azure##
Open the **Bot Framework Emulator**
Enter your Azure messaging endpoint, **App ID** and **App Password** and begin testing

##Connect your Bot to additional channels##
Now your Bot is up and running, return to [https://dev.botframework.com](https://dev.botframework.com) and configure more channels for it to talk on.
